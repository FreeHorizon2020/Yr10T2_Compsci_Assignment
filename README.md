# Year 10 Term 2 CMT Assignment
This is my school project that i had to do for the school. most of the project (html, css etc.) is from the file that my school got from github, the part that i did end up doing was the Javascript, making a fun little thing known as a Reverse Polish Notation Calculator, or RPN calculator.

## Instructions:
For this their is a few instructions on how to make the calculator work as intended. these are:
1. The input must be in RPN, which is 5 5 + as an example
2. You cannot use negative numbers, as that will break the calculator.
3. if you divide something by 0, it will not work and give you either a NaN or infinity
4. their is a charachter limit before the code breaks. which is massive yes but if you get infinity for an answer you have most likely surpassed it. 
    4. Updated. charachter limit has been updated to not allow numbers past a certain threshold.
5. keep the amount of spaces to 1 or 2 between numbers, otherwise it will asume one as a operator and break the calcualtor.

Apart from these rules their isn't much else. if you break anything else please add it so i can eventually get to fixing it.
testing to attempt from different computers. 

## Most recent Update:
- added a charachter limit to stop infinity.
- Added instructions within the websites. 
- Added a dark mode to aid the eyes.
